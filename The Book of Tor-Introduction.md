Dear Reddit user,

I don't know you or where you are from. I don't know how old you are or your level education or really anything about you. This short book won't cover everything about Tor. It will also not talk down to you like you are five years old. I am assuming that you are a relatively intelligent human being who can read a book. First of all, it will answer your question. It will also help you understand what it is that you are asking and to dispel a lot of preconceived notions about what Tor is and isn't.

One final note, this is the only time that I will use the terms: “Dark Web”, “Deep Web”, “Marianas Web”. The “Dark Web” is the Tor Onion Router network, also known as Tor. The “Deep Web” is any service that can only be accessed by VPN or other routing means except Tor. Your company has an intranet for HR. That's the Deep Web. If you make your own network at home to stream movies to your TV, you've made your own Deep Web. Once you shine light on 
these terms, you realize that they are just click-bait and don't really describe anything useful. As for the Marianas Web, it is completely fiction.
