## Begin at the Beginning

Let's begin with something useful. We'll do this in four parts for Windows, Linux, Mac, and Android users.

### Installing The Tor Browser

#### Windows

1. Go to: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

2. Download the latest version for Windows

3. Run the installer

4. You will now see a new folder on your Desktop. Open that and run Tor Browser.

5. Click Connect

6. Congrats, you are on Tor!

7. Go to https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ in the Tor Browser

#### Linux

1. Go to: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

2. Download the latest version for Linux

3. Open a command line

4. Unzip the application. Replace xxxxxx with the current version that you downloaded

`tar -xvJf tor-browser-linux64-xxxxxx.tar.xz`

5. You will now see a new folder. Open that and run Tor Browser.

`cd tor-browser_en`

6. Run the application

`./start-tor-browser.desktop`

7. Click Connect

8. Congrats, you are on Tor!

9. Go to https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ in the Tor Browser

#### Mac

1. Go to: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

2. Download the latest version for Mac

3. Run the installer

4. You will now see a new folder on your Desktop. Open that and run Tor Browser.

5. Click Connect

6. Congrats, you are on Tor!

7. Go to https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ in the Tor Browser

#### Android

1. Go to the app store and download the following two apps: Orfox 
   and Orbot. Both are from The Tor Project. Orbot is the Tor service. Orfox is the Android implementation of the Tor Browser. There are many "Dark Web" and "Onion" android apps and many of them are bogus and may steal your data or are just scams.

2. Start Orbot and connect to the Tor network.

3. Start Orfox

4. Go to https://www.facebookcorewwwi.onion/ in Orfox.



### What did we do?

In this section, we installed the Tor browser for the operating system of your choice. WIth the exception of Android, the Tor browser actually runs a copy of the Tor application inside of it which you can connect to as a socks proxy on port 9150. On Android, the Orbot app takes care of that for you.
